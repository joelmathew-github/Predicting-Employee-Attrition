# Predicting-Employee-Attrition

A health consultancy company intends to bring down the cost of retaining its employees. We try and identify factors that drive the employees in this company to attrition,
which would help predict if an employee is at the risk of attrition. The company can then target incentives towards such employees, and also prepare in advance to replace 
employees who would most likely attrite.
We also build 2 models to predict the attrition - one with Logistic Regression and the other with Random Forest and we compare their perfromance.
